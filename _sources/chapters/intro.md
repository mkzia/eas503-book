## Academic Integrity

:::{warning}
Academic integrity stands as a cornerstone value within the university setting. By engaging in honest and authentic academic work, students uphold the integrity of the university's mission to disseminate knowledge and foster innovative ideas. The UB graduate academic integrity policy can be accessed at [UB Graduate Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity).

It is imperative to note that sharing or seeking assistance through platforms such as Chegg, Stack Overflow, and Course Hero in relation to EAS 503 assignments constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy. The consequences of violating this policy can range from receiving zero points for assignments to expulsion from the university, contingent upon the severity of the violation.

The academic integrity policies specific to this course are as follows:

1. Submission of identical homework solutions by multiple students will result in all parties involved earning zero points for those shared solutions.
2. If a student's identity is verified as the source of uploaded content on any online platform, an automatic failure in the course will be incurred.
3. Any student positively identified as viewing the solution for any problem, regardless of duration, will receive a score of zero for the problem(s) viewed.

All breaches of academic integrity will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Repeated violations will lead to escalated sanctions.

Embrace sound cyber-security practices. Refrain from granting physical or electronic access to your computer or accounts. Sharing access that leads to another student violating the Academic Integrity Policy makes you liable.

**Example 1:** Student A is identified as posting an assignment question on Chegg. The consequence is an "F" in the course, along with reporting to the University.

**Example 2:** Students B and C collaborate on an assignment. Student B provides code assistance to Student C, who utilizes it to complete the assignment. Both students receive a zero for the entire assignment and are reported to the University.

**Example 3:** Students D and E collaborate verbally but do not share code. No violation of academic integrity occurs.

**Example 4:** Student F's non-functional computer leads Student G to allow access. Code copying occurs, resulting in both students earning a zero and reporting to the University.

**Submission of work for grading indicates acceptance of the academic integrity policy.**

**Important Note:** If you come across a solution on a website (Chegg), be aware that it could potentially be intentionally placed there by the instructor to identify instances of academic misconduct. Always approach your coursework with integrity and refrain from using any unauthorized resources. Your commitment to academic honesty is essential to your personal growth and the integrity of the educational process.

**Codio can detect cheating:** Codio’s code editor is the industry-standard editor used in the VSCode IDE. We require you to complete your assignments in Codio partly for autograding reasons but also because Codio has very advanced keystroke analysis tools for generating insights into how students complete their work, including similarity checkers, time spent in error state, external pastes and insertion/deletion tracking.  So do not copy and paste your solution from another location. Do all your work inside the Codio editor. All your keystrokes and copy and pastes are recorded and can be played back.
