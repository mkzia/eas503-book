# Arithmetic Operators

{numref}`arithmetic-operators` lists the arithmetic operators.

```{table} Arithmetic operators
:name: arithmetic-operators
| **Symbol**  | **Operator**      | **Example**  | **Result**  |
|------------ |------------------ |------------- |------------ |
| -           | Negation          | -5           | -5          |
| +           | Addition          | 11 + 3.1     | 14.1        |
| -           | Subtraction       | 5 - 19       | -14         |
| *           | Multiplication    | 8.5 * 4      | 34.0        |
| /           | Division          | 11 / 2       | 5.5         |
| //          | Integer Division  | 16 // 5      | 3           |
| %           | Modulus/Remainder | 31 % 24      | 7           |
| **          | Exponentiation    | 2 ** 5       | 32          |
```

Operators that have two operands are called **binary operators**. Negation is a **unary** operator because it applies to one operand.

## Negation

The negation operator simply negates the value.

```{code-cell} ipython3
-5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
--5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
---5
```

## Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

- The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators are the familiar mathematical operators.

:::{warning}
When the operands are of mixed data type, meaning `int` and `float`, the resulting value will be type `float`.

## Integer Division, Modulo, and Exponentiation

To know the integer part of a division result, use the integer division operator. For example, to know how many 24-hour days there are in 53 hours.

```{code-cell} ipython3
53 // 24
```

To find out how many hours are left over, you can use the modulo operator, which gives the remainder of the division:

```{code-cell} ipython3
53 % 24 
```

:::{warning}
Python integer division rounds towards negative infinity. This is different from truncation. Truncation would just drop the digits after the decimal. So, be careful with negative operands!
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
17 // 10
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
-17 // 10
```

`-1.7` rounded towards negative infinity is `-2`.

For the modulo operator, the sign of the result matches the sign of the divisors (the second operand)

```{code-cell} ipython3
-17 % 10
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
17 % 10
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
17 % -10
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
-17 % 10
```

The following expression calculates 3 raised to the 6th power:

```{code-cell} ipython3
3 ** 6
```
